<h1>Basic PHP Crud Operations With PHP & MySQL</h1>

Everyday is a learning day !

Normally, before we move directly to databases, you guys have to learn basic opeartions of PHP. These operations known to be "CRUD". CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete(CRUD). This repository will help you to put your hands together in learning basic PHP CRUD opeartions.

This repository gives you the knowledge of,

Creating Records
Selecting Records
Updating Records
Deleting Records

The technologies I've used :

PHP
Bootstrap
HTML
XAMMP Server
MySQL
Text Editior - Visual Studio Code

Before, you work on this , you have to install the new version of the XAMPP server and the MySQL server.

[XAMPP Server](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
[MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)

And I've used some bootsrap codes in my project. You can get the bootsrap codes through the following link :

Thank You Guys & Good Luck!!
